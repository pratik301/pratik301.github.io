                        While a 27-story, two billion-dollar house for six people in the most poverty-stricken area of India might seem
						a tad bit extravagant to most, the richest man in India and sixth richest in the world, Mukesh Ambani, seems to 
						have missed the memo. And thatâ€™s precisely why there is a towering skyscraper called Antilia that reaches 550 
						feet with over 400,000 square feet of interior space against the Mumbai skyline.Antilia is a private home in South
						Mumbai, India. It is owned by Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries and has a staff of 600 to maintain
						the residence 24 hours a day.

                        As of November 2014, it is deemed to be the world's most expensive residential property, after Buckingham Palace,
						which is designated as a crown property. It is thus the world's most expensive private residential property,valued
						over $1 billion. Its controversial design and ostentatious use by a single family has made it infamous across the 
						world, with severe criticism in the architectural press and mockery in popular media.Antilia was built in 
						consultation with US architecture firms Perkins and Will & Hirsch Bedner Associates (though neither firm lists it as
						a Notable Project), with the Australian-based construction company Leighton Holdings initially taking charge of its 
						construction.
